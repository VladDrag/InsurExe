Insurance Policy Maintenance and Claim Management Process .Net Project using C# and SQL Server


An insurance management system is a personal intranet-based web application developed by a group of insurance broker agents to make your insurance policy and claim review process easier and more flexible.

The web application is used to check and monitor the status of customers who have adopted new policies in the context of distributed access in your organization, and to notify them of the terms of the policy’s premium payments and requirements.
In fact, the system is designed to accelerate the process in your business process to increase customer satisfaction and keep the overall flow of customers in this domain smooth and stable.
